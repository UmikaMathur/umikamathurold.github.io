     <h3>What makes us human?, Digital Video, 2018</h3>
     <p>The following found footage is a collection of visuals from the documentary, HUMAN on YouTube and audio from Soundcloud meant to bring about reflection and question. The concept I had in mind is the question: What makes us human? I envision this installation to be played in a dimly lit room with a vast projection of this video on a wall, and those who view it can sit on bean bags and be able to reflect or connect (or both) with the video on a deeper level. I chose to appropriate the material I found from a documentary about humanity because I wanted to communicate the same topics in my video as well and I admired the variety of diverse individuals and footage that I found when I envisioned what I wanted to communicate through this project; the original documentary was presented on YouTube in its full length, and I used and edited certain clips I admired for this video project.</p>
