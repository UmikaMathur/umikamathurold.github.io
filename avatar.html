   <p>I chose to use the images/location of Disneyland. For some reason, the first area that came to my mind when I thought of a location was Disneyland. It is an interesting location because it is widely known by many people, and I wanted to see what I could change it into. This place was an important part of my childhood, and I will always remember my visits to Disneyland growing up. I chose to create a video game type of collage, mixing certain aspects of Disneyland, with video game features/characteristics that I grew up playing with. Usually, the goal in many video games is to get at the highest level, which I represented with the real image of the castle. I also added different roller coasters to give it a hyper real, otherworldly effect. To continue with the video game theme, I added other images that are popular in the Super Mario games such as the blocks he jumps on, and the clouds beneath the castle to make it look as if it was floating. I chose to use a mixture of images from real life as well as video games to compare reality with video games. Many people use video games as a form of an escape from the world, which can often end up being someone else’s entirely different reality, so I wanted to bring these two interesting worlds together in order to enhance both their meanings. The placement of my images in this collage symbolize the level of “greatness” with each image. I made the castle float in the air, and made some roller coasters larger than others to indicate that I think they are both intimidating and in your face usually. The function of my image in my opinion, seems overall lighthearted and reminiscent of my childhood. I would choose to print the image large or use it as a screensaver.
