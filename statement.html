  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>I am interested in using technology as a tool for art. My subject matter revolves around my fascination with technologyâ€™s ability to reach a large audience and the fact that the internet has the capacity for unlimited and constant creation.

</p>
  <p>Sometimes my work is very direct and other times it has a more abstract approach, leaving it open for interpretation by the viewer. I find that art in general has the ability to make people think about subjects beyond the surface, and that is what inspires me in my artwork. I like to use my creativity to make new images that are surreal and unique but also lighthearted. Using art as a form of expression allows me to look deeper into what makes us human and connects us despite our differences. My process is also a reflexive look into what is art in technology, what is considered as art, and when do things get assigned value in society.
