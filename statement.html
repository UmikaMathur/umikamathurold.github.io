  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>My artwork mainly involves technology and certain software, to be specific. I am interested in exploring different concepts within my artwork and using different mediums to convey what I choose to create. The reason behind what I choose for my artwork revolves around my fascination with the way technology is able to reach a larger audience and the fact that the internet and its abilities are unlimited for constant creation.
</p>
  <p>The process I use for my artwork varies due to the different resources I explore, such as Photoshop, Premiere, Audacity, etc. I like to make my work convey either a deep message or leave it open for interpretation by the viewer. I find that art in general has the ability to make others think about certain topics beyond the surface, and that is what inspires me in my artwork. I work with different software tools such as Photoshop, Audacity, Premiere Pro, Atom, etc. to communicate my thoughts and ideas in order to translate it into art. Most of my work either revolves around a specific topic or has no implied message and I prefer to leave it open for interpretation by the viewer. I like to work with these tools and technology because it is an excellent way to reach a larger audience and gives me the freedom to broadcast myself as a developing artist.
